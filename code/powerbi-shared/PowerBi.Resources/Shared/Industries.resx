    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    <value>&lt;p&gt;Operations Engineers at major airlines, responsible for a fleet of aircraft, must constantly weigh the cost and disruption of ad hoc maintenance against the risk and even higher cost of technical failures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report in this solution provides an overview of the fleet’s status as well as a summary of predictions for near term changes to the fleet’s technical health.  The predictions are based on multiple machine learning models and use the aircrafts' Quick Access Recorder (similar to the Black Box) along with other data sources. The report shows a detailed output from one of the contributing machine learning models which predicts the remaining useful life for critical engine components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report is visually rich and provides an overview of the flight plans and locations to help decide where an aircraft should be serviced and which other aircraft is best positioned to replace it. The report also includes a custom Sankey chart to rationalize the fleets’ different KPI weightings based on the types of airframes, and a striking 3D heat map in the shape of a jet engine.

    <value>&lt;p&gt;Storing energy is not cost-effective, so utilities and power generators need to forecast future power consumption so that they can efficiently balance the supply with the demand. During peak hours, short supply can result in power outages. Conversely, too much supply can result in waste of resources. Advanced demand forecasting techniques detail hourly demand and peak hours for a particular day, allowing an energy provider to optimize the power generation process. This report focuses on demand forecasting within the energy sector. The report provides region level energy usage status and forecast of future usage for optimizing the operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ‘Energy Solution Status Summary’ page shows the overall status of energy demand of each region. User can select a single region by clicking the filter on the left to investigate each region's status.&lt;/p&gt;

    <value>&lt;p&gt;Businesses need an effective strategy for managing customer churn. Customer churn includes customers stopping the use of a service, switching to a competitor service, switching to a lower-tier experience in the service or reducing engagement with the service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this use case, we look at how a mobile phone carrier company can leverage Azure to proactively identify customers more likely to churn in the near term in order to improve the service and create custom outreach campaigns that help retain the customers. Mobile phone carriers face an extremely competitive market. Many mobile carriers lose revenue from postpaid customers due to churn. Hence the ability to proactively and accurately identify customer churn at scale can be a huge competitive advantage. Some of the factors contributing to mobile phone customer churn includes: Perceived frequent service disruptions, poor customer service experiences in online/retail stores, offers from other competing carriers (better family plan, data plan, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A mobile carrier needs to build a 360-degree view of their user base to enable the company to stay ahead of the competition.&lt;/p&gt;</value>

    <value>&lt;h3&gt;Education&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the statistics show, enrolment in Primary Education is growing apace as progress is made in particular in the developing world, partly on foot of the Millennium Development Goals which prioritized primary school enrolment. However, almost 1 in 10 children globally are still out of school and a disproportionate number of these (60%) are girls. Enrollment in Higher Education has also grown but remains at a low level globally, with huge disparities between nations in the developed and the developing world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The correlation with GDP is consistent, but what is worthy of note is a slight decline in the percentage of GDP allocated to education in part impacted by the last recession. It is heartening to see that the gender gap is closing with regard to Higher Education enrolment, but as stated above this picture changes dramatically when we compare the developed and the developing world, and is not matched by enrolments at primary school level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Health&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we look at the data, life expectancy has increased over the years which is widely acknowledged. What stands out is that the difference in the life expectancy of female versus male has remained the same over the years. It is evident, as a countries allocate more funds towards Health the country’s population is benefiting from it.  It is interesting to note that the fertility rate is going down as the GDP improves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Small Business&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a business friendly environment is created, the rate of New Business registered is going up. The correlation with GDP is evident. It is worth noting that the peak of Small Business activity was prior to the last recession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Climate Change&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Climate change is a controversial topic. Looking at the data, we can confirm some of the known variables. There is a direct correlation between GDP and CO2 emission. As the economy of a country improves CO2 emission increases. This phenomenon is not dependent on the source of electricity production. Also as a countries population increases so does the CO2 emission. You will notice a similar trend when we compare some of the top countries in terms of economy and population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data also shows that the average temperature is on the rise. You will notice that the temperature rise is not a steady incline. All the projection models indicate temperature rising over the years.&lt;/p&gt;</value>
