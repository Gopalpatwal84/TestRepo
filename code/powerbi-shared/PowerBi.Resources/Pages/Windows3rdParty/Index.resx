    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

                &lt;li&gt;License Grants and Conditions&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ol&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;2.1. Grants&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license:&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark) Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available, modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or as part of a Larger Work; and&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its Contributions or its Contributor Version.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;2.2. Effective Date&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first distributes such Contribution.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor Version); or&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its Contributions.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the notice requirements in Section 3.4).&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;2.4. Subsequent Licenses&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;2.5. Representation&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;2.6. Fair Use&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;2.7. Conditions&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in Section 2.1.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;ol start="3"&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Responsibilities&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ol&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;3.1. Distribution of Source Form&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;3.2. Distribution of Executable Form&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice, provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary License(s).&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;3.4. Notices&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;3.5. Application of Additional Terms&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any jurisdiction.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;ol start="4"&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ol&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;ol start="5"&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Termination&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ol&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License shall terminate.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to termination shall survive termination.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;ol start="6"&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Disclaimer of Warranty&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ol&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is" basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You. Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;ol start="7"&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Limitation of Liability&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ol&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;ol start="8"&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Litigation&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ol&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;ol start="9"&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Miscellaneous&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ol&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;ol start="10"&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Versions of the License&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ol&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;10.1. New Versions&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section 10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;10.2. Effect of New Versions&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license steward.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;10.3. Modified Versions&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such modified license differs from this License).&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/ol&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The terms "reproduce," "reproduction," "derivative works," and "distribution" have the same meaning here as under U.S. copyright law.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A "contribution" is the original software, or any additions or changes to the software.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A "contributor" is any person that distributes its contribution under this license.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;"Licensed patents" are a contributor's patent claims that read directly on its contribution.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/ol&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;(A) Copyright Grant- Subject to the terms of this license, including the license conditions and limitations in section 3, each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce its contribution, prepare derivative works of its contribution, and distribute its contribution or any derivative works that you create.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;(B) Patent Grant- Subject to the terms of this license, including the license conditions and limitations in section 3, each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license under its licensed patents to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, import, and/or otherwise dispose of its contribution in the software or derivative works of the contribution in the software.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/ol&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;(A) No Trademark License- This license does not grant you rights to use any contributors' name, logo, or trademarks.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;(B) If you bring a patent claim against any contributor over patents that you claim are infringed by the software, your patent license from such contributor to the software ends automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;(C) If you distribute any portion of the software, you must retain all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices that are present in the software.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;(D) If you distribute any portion of the software in source code form, you may do so only under this license by including a complete copy of this license with your distribution. If you distribute any portion of the software in compiled or object code form, you may only do so under a license that complies with this license.&lt;/p&gt;
