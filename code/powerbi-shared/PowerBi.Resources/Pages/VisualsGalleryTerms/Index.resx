    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            These terms of use are a contract between you and Microsoft Corporation (“&lt;strong&gt;Microsoft&lt;/strong&gt;”). These terms apply to your access and use of the
            Power BI Visuals Gallery, including any software, services, catalogues, data, sites, information, materials, content and updates made available to you
        through the Power BI Visuals Gallery (the “Gallery”) (collectively, “&lt;strong&gt;Services&lt;/strong&gt;”).    &lt;strong&gt;By using the Gallery or any Service, you agree to these terms of use. If you do not agree, you may not use the Gallery or any Service.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;1. &lt;/strong&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Visualizations on the Gallery&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The Gallery enables you to obtain visualizations (“Visualizations”) and deploy them. Each Visualization is distributed and licensed to you by the publisher
            whose name is indicated in the catalog listing for the Visualization, not by Microsoft. Information about the Visualization, including information that
            appears in the catalog or information on which sorting depends, also originates from the publisher, and Microsoft is not responsible for its accuracy.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Your use of a Visualization is subject to any legal terms provided by the publisher of the Visualization. Microsoft is not a party to any legal terms
            provided by the publisher and does not assess or guarantee their accuracy or completeness. No right or license to any intellectual property of Microsoft or
            any of its affiliates is granted with respect to any Visualizations. You are responsible for identifying, understanding and complying with the relevant
            legal terms for any Visualization you use.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Microsoft does not guarantee, endorse or assume any liability for the Visualizations or information about the Visualizations, and it does not provide any
            support for the Visualizations.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;2. &lt;/strong&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Submitting Visualizations&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            a. The Gallery enables you to submit a Visualization for others to use and to submit information to accompany the Visualization (which may include, for
            example, information about you, information about the contents of the Visualization, a link to your legal terms, and a graphic image file). If you submit
            anything to the Gallery (collectively, your “submission”), it is subject to these terms of use. You grant Microsoft the right to host, copy, publicly
            perform, publicly display and distribute the information in association with the Visualization you submit (for example, on the Gallery itself) and to
            modify the information to correct any errors and to conform to format requirements or other policies.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            b. You, not Microsoft, are licensing to the user the right to use the Visualization. When you submit a Visualization, the Gallery provides a method for you
            to include legal terms (including any applicable privacy statement) for your Visualization. You, not Microsoft, are responsible for providing all necessary
            or relevant legal terms (including any applicable privacy statement) for your Visualization. If the legal terms that apply to your Visualization or any
            code or component included in it impose obligations on the distributor of the Visualization, code or component, it is your responsibility as the publisher
            of the Visualization to comply with those obligations.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            c. Only these terms of use, and not any legal terms you provide, apply to Microsoft’s inclusion of your submission in the Gallery.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            d. Microsoft is not obligated to accept, post or maintain what you submit, and may remove a submission and any part of it at any time in its sole
            discretion. You may choose later to unpublish your submission after its publication to the Gallery. If you do so, their availability on Microsoft caches
            might not cease immediately, copies may persist in locations not in the control of Microsoft (such as Power BI user dashboards and reports and other web
            sites that consume a data feed from the Gallery), and Microsoft may retain copies of your submission.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            e. You represent and warrant that your submission (a) does not violate the rights of any third party, including intellectual property rights, (b) complies
            with any license or other legal terms applicable to any component or code included in it, (c) does not contain any profane, defamatory, obscene, or
            unlawful content, (d) complies with all laws and regulations and fulfills all applicable regulatory and licensing requirements including, but not limited
            to laws, regulations and regulatory requirements with respect to the collection, use or disclosure of any user data, including providing notice and
            obtaining consent for collection, use or disclosure of user data and (e) does not contain any viruses, Trojan horses, worms, time bombs, cancelbots, or
            software code that is intended, designed or likely to interfere with the operation of another’s computer or property or to operate in a manner prohibited
            by law.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            f. No compensation will be paid for your submission, and you may not seek (whether through the legal terms you submit or otherwise) to impose any charge on
            users for use of your submission they obtain through the Gallery. This does not preclude you for seeking to impose a charge for what users obtain from you
            other than through the Gallery.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;3. &lt;/strong&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Acceptable use&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            You may not interfere or attempt to interfere in any manner with the functionality or proper performance of the Gallery or the Services. You may not access
            or use the Gallery or the Services for any unlawful, harmful or deceptive purpose or in any way that is illegal or promotes illegal activities. Without
            limitation, you may not access or use them in any manner that (a) is discriminatory based on race, sex, religion, nationality, disability, sexual
            orientation, or age, (b) is defamatory, offensive, malicious or harmful to any person or entity, (c) would violate local, state, federal or other
            applicable privacy regulations, (d) is intended, designed or likely to damage, disable, overburden, or impair or to gain unauthorized access to the
            Services or any server or network of Microsoft or to other accounts, computer systems or networks connected to them, or (e) would use any information
            obtained through them for spamming, unsolicited sales or any advertising, or marketing. You may not frame, mirror, or incorporate the Gallery user
            interface in part or in whole within your own online environment.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;4. &lt;/strong&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Privacy practices&lt;/strong&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            The links made available on the Gallery will let you leave this web site. The linked sites are not under the control of Microsoft, and Microsoft is not
            responsible for the contents of any linked site or any link contained in a linked site. The inclusion of any link does not imply that Microsoft endorses
            the site.
        &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;NO WARRANTY&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            THE Gallery and all the Services are provided "as-is," "with all faults" and "as available." On behalf of itself and its suppliers, licensors, service
            providers, vendors, resellers and affiliates (collectively, the "&lt;strong&gt;Microsoft Parties&lt;/strong&gt;"), Microsoft disclaims any and all warranties,
            guarantees and conditions of purchase for THE Gallery and the Services, including any implied warranties including those of merchantability, title, fitness

        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;9. &lt;/strong&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;LIMITATION OF LIABILITY&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL MICROSOFT PARTIES BE LIABLE UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY (WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT
            OR OTHERWISE) FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
            DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA OR OTHER INFORMATION, USE, GOODWILL) ARISING OUT OF, BASED ON, OR RESULTING FROM YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
            GALLERY OR THE SERVICES. WITHOUT LIMITING THE ABOVE, MICROSOFT PARTIES SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES RESULTING FROM (A) COST OF PROCURING SUBSTITUTE
            GOODS, DATA, SOFTWARE PROGRAMS, CONTENT OR SERVICES; (B) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OR USE OF YOUR ACCOUNTS; (C) ANY ALTERATION, CORRUPTION, DELETION, DAMAGE
            OR LOSS OF ANYTHING USED IN CONNECTION WITH THE GALLERY OR THE SERVICES; (D) FAILURE TO PROVIDE ACCURATE OR COMPLETE INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO THE
            GALLERY OR THE SERVICES; (E) ANY VIRUSES OR OTHER DISABLING FEATURES THAT AFFECT YOUR ONLINE ACCESS TO OR USE OF THE GALLERY OR THE SERVICES; (F)
            INCOMPATIBILITIES BETWEEN THE GALLERY OR THE SERVICES AND OTHER SERVICES, SOFTWARE OR HARDWARE; (G) ANY THIRD-PARTY CONDUCT OR TRANSMISSIONS OR DATA. THESE
            LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY APPLY EVEN TO LOSSES OF WHICH MICROSOFT PARTIES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY. SUCH LOSSES WILL NOT CONSTITUTE A FAILURE OF
            THIS AGREEMENT’S ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h5&gt;
            10. Duty to defend
        &lt;/h5&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Microsoft and Microsoft’s affiliates, as applicable, from and against (including by paying any associated
            costs, losses, damages, or expenses and attorneys’ fees) any and all third-party claims alleging that your Visualization infringes any proprietary or
            personal right of a third party or arising from any dispute between you and a third party relating to your Visualization.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Microsoft will (a) notify you promptly in writing of the claim, provided that Microsoft’s failure to notify you will not relieve you of any liability
            except to the extent that such failure materially prejudices your legal rights; and (b) at your reasonable request, provide you with reasonable assistance
            in defending the claim. You agree to reimburse Microsoft or Microsoft’s Affiliates, as applicable, for any reasonable out-of-­pocket expenses incurred in
            providing such assistance. You may not make any settlement or compromise of a claim, or admit or stipulate any fault or liability on the part of Microsoft
            or Microsoft’s Affiliates with respect to any claim covered by this section without Microsoft’s express, prior written consent.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;11. &lt;/strong&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Reservation of rights&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Microsoft reserves all rights not expressly granted in these terms of use. No additional rights (including implied licenses, rights or covenants) are
            granted by implication, estoppel or otherwise.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;12. &lt;/strong&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Choice of law and location for resolving disputes&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The law of Washington state, U.S.A., governs the interpretation of these terms of use and applies to claims relating to them, regardless of conflict of
            laws principles. You and we irrevocably consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state or federal courts in King County, Washington, USA, for
            all disputes arising out of or relating to the Gallery or these terms of use.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;13. &lt;/strong&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Interpreting these terms of use&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            If a court holds that we cannot enforce a part of these terms of use as written, then you and we agree that the court will replace that part with terms
            that most closely reflect our intention, and the rest of these terms of use will not change. These terms of use form the entire agreement regarding your
            use of the Gallery and the Services and supersede any prior agreements or statements (whether oral or written) regarding such use.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;14. &lt;/strong&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Updates to terms of use&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                We may change these terms of use at any time, with or without prior notice to you. Changes will apply to your use of the Gallery and the Services
                starting from when the changes are made. If you do not agree with any changes, you may not continue to use the Gallery.
            &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

            These license terms are an agreement between you and the visualization developer. Please read them. They apply to the visualization you download from the
            Power BI Visuals Gallery, including any updates or supplements for the visualization (the “Visualization”), unless the Visualization comes with separate
            terms, in which case those terms apply.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;
                BY DOWNLOADING OR USING THE VISUALIZATION, OR ATTEMPTING TO DO ANY OF THESE, YOU ACCEPT THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THEM, YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO
                AND MUST NOT DOWNLOAD OR USE THE VISUALIZATION.
            &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;The Visualization developer means the entity licensing the Visualization to you, as identified in the Power BI Visuals Gallery.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;If you comply with these license terms, you have the rights below. &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;1. &lt;/strong&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS.&lt;/strong&gt;
            You may install and use one copy of the Visualization for use with a product or service that supports the Power BI visual interface.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;2. &lt;/strong&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;INTERNET-BASED SERVICES. &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            a. &lt;strong&gt;Consent for Internet-Based or Wireless Services.&lt;/strong&gt; The Visualization connects to computer systems over the Internet, which may include
            via a wireless network. Using the Visualization operates as your consent to the transmission of standard device information (including but not limited to
            technical information about your device, system and Visualization software, and peripherals) for internet-based or wireless services.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            b. &lt;strong&gt;Misuse of Internet-based Services.&lt;/strong&gt; You may not use any Internet-based service in any way that could harm it or impair anyone else’s use
            of it or the wireless network. You may not use the service to try to gain unauthorized access to any service, data, account or network by any means.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;3. &lt;/strong&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;SCOPE OF LICENSE.&lt;/strong&gt;
            The Visualization is licensed, not sold. This agreement only gives you some rights to use the Visualization. Visualization developer reserves all other
            rights. Unless applicable law gives you more rights despite this limitation, you may use the Visualization only as expressly permitted in this agreement.
            You may not
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            • work around any technical limitations in the Visualization;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            • reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the Visualization, except and only to the extent that applicable law expressly permits, despite this
            limitation;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            • make more copies of the Visualization than specified in this agreement or allowed by applicable law, despite this limitation; or
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            • publish or otherwise make the Visualization available for others to copy.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;4. &lt;/strong&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;DOCUMENTATION.&lt;/strong&gt;
            If documentation is provided with the Visualization, you may copy and use the documentation for personal reference purposes.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;5. &lt;/strong&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;TECHNOLOGY AND EXPORT RESTRICTIONS.&lt;/strong&gt;
            The Visualization may be subject to United States or international technology control or export laws and regulations. You must comply with all domestic and
            international export laws and regulations that apply to the technology used or supported by the Visualization. These laws include restrictions on
            destinations, end users and end use. For information on Microsoft branded products, see www.microsoft.com/exporting.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;6. &lt;/strong&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;SUPPORT SERVICES.&lt;/strong&gt;
            Microsoft is not responsible for providing support services for the Visualization. If Microsoft is the Visualization developer, it may provide support
            services, but is not obligated to do so under this agreement. Contact the Visualization developer to determine what support services are available.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;7. &lt;/strong&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;ENTIRE AGREEMENT.&lt;/strong&gt;
            This agreement, any applicable Visualization developer privacy policy, and the terms for supplements and updates are the entire agreement between you and
            Visualization developer for the Visualization. If Microsoft is the Visualization developer, this agreement does not change the terms of your relationship
            with Microsoft with regard to Power BI, including the Power BI Visuals Gallery.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;8. &lt;/strong&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;APPLICABLE LAW. &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            a.
            &lt;strong&gt;
                United States. If you acquired the Visualization in the United States, Washington state law governs the interpretation of this agreement and applies to
                claims for breach of it, regardless of conflict of laws principles. The laws of the state where you live govern all other claims, including claims
                under state consumer protection laws, unfair competition laws, and in tort.
            &lt;/strong&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            b. &lt;strong&gt;Outside the United States. If you acquired the Visualization in any other country, the laws of that country apply. &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;9. &lt;/strong&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;LEGAL EFFECT.&lt;/strong&gt;
            This agreement describes certain legal rights. You may have other rights under the laws of your state or country. This agreement does not change your
            rights under the laws of your state or country if the laws of your state or country do not permit it to do so.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;10. &lt;/strong&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;
                DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, (A) THE VISUALIZATION IS LICENSED "AS-IS," "WITH ALL FAULTS," AND "AS AVAILABLE" AND
                YOU BEAR ALL RISK OF USING IT; (B) THE VISUALIZATION DEVELOPER, ON BEHALF OF ITSELF, MICROSOFT (IF MICROSOFT IS NOT THE VISUALIZATION DEVELOPER), AND
                EACH OF OUR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES, VENDORS, AGENTS AND SUPPLIERS, GIVES NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES, OR CONDITIONS IN RELATION TO THE
                VISUALIZATION; (C) YOU MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL CONSUMER RIGHTS UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAWS THAT THIS AGREEMENT CANNOT CHANGE; AND (D) VISUALIZATION DEVELOPER AND
                MICROSOFT EXCLUDE ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS, INCLUDING THOSE OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
            &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;11. &lt;/strong&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;
                LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF REMEDIES AND DAMAGES. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, YOU CAN RECOVER FROM THE VISUALIZATION DEVELOPER ONLY DIRECT
                DAMAGES UP TO THE AMOUNT YOU PAID FOR THE VISUALIZATION OR $1.00, WHICHEVER IS GREATER. YOU WILL NOT, AND WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO, SEEK TO RECOVER ANY OTHER
                DAMAGES, INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST PROFITS, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES FROM THE VISUALIZATION DEVELOPER.
            &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;This limitation applies to&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            • &lt;strong&gt;anything related to the Visualization or services made available through the Visualization; and&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            •
            &lt;strong&gt;
                claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty, guarantee or condition, strict liability, negligence, or other tort to the extent permitted by
                applicable law.
            &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;It also applies even if&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            • &lt;strong&gt;repair, replacement or a refund for the Visualization does not fully compensate you for any losses; or&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            • &lt;strong&gt;Visualization developer knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages. &lt;/strong&gt;
