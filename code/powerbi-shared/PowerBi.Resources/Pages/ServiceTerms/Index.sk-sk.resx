    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    <value>&lt;div class=&quot;col-xs-12&quot;&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;subtitle-bold&quot;&gt;Thank you for choosing Microsoft!&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;This is an agreement between you and Microsoft Corporation that describes your rights to use the Power BI preview software and service (the &#39;Service&#39;). When using the Service, you must abide by these terms (&#39;this Agreement&#39;). Please also note that in order to use this Service, you need to be located in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;You may sign up for a Microsoft organizational account with an email address provided by your organization (e.g., your employer or educational institution). Please be advised that if you sign up and use the Service with an organizational account (e.g., your work email), the owner of the organizational domain (e.g., your employer or educational institution) may subsequently be able to assume control of your account and obtain access to your data and prior network activities.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;For your convenience, we have phrased some of the terms of this Agreement in a question and answer format. You should read the entire Agreement because all of the terms are important and together create a legal agreement that, once accepted by you, applies to you.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;ol&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;din-regular&quot;&gt;Acceptance and changes to agreement&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;ol&gt;
                    &lt;li&gt;How do I accept this agreement? By using or accessing the Service, or by agreeing to these terms where the option is made available to you in the user interface, you agree to abide by this Agreement without modification by you. If you don&#39;t agree, you may not use the Service.&lt;/li&gt;
                    &lt;li&gt;Can Microsoft change this Agreement after I&#39;ve accepted it? Yes. From time to time, Microsoft may change or amend these terms. If we do, we&#39;ll notify you, either through the user interface, in an email message, or through other reasonable means. If you use the Service after the date the change becomes effective, you consent to the changed terms. If you don&#39;t agree to the changes, you must stop using the Service. Otherwise, the new terms will apply to you.&lt;/li&gt;
                    &lt;li&gt;What types of changes can I expect to the Service? We continuously work to improve the Service and may change the Service at any time. Since the Service is preview in nature, it may not work correctly or in the same way the final version may work. From time to time we may stop providing portions of the Service. We may do so, for example, if it&#39;s no longer feasible for us to provide a Service, the technology advances, customer feedback indicates a change is needed, our agreements with third parties no longer permit us to make their material available, or external issues arise that make it imprudent or impractical to continue.&lt;/li&gt;
                    &lt;li&gt;What about feedback? How will my feedback be used? By agreeing to use the Service you agree to provide feedback to Microsoft. You license to Microsoft without charge all intellectual property or other rights necessary for Microsoft to use, share, and commercialize in any way or for any purpose any feedback. You also license to all third parties without charge all intellectual property or other rights necessary for their products, technologies and services to use or interface with any specific parts of a Microsoft software or service that includes the feedback. You will not give feedback that is subject to any license that requires Microsoft to license its software or documentation or services to third parties because we include our feedback in them. The rights granted in this paragraph are perpetual and world-wide and survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;/ol&gt;
            &lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;din-regular&quot;&gt;Your Data&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;ol&gt;
                    &lt;li&gt;Who owns the Content that I put on the Service?
                        &lt;p&gt;As between Microsoft and You, You do, unless the owner of your organizational account has assumed control of your account. The Service enables you to communicate with others and share or store various types of files, such as photos, documents, music and video. The contents of your communications and your files are your &#39;Content&#39; and, except for material that we license to you that may be incorporated into your own Content (such as clip art), we don&#39;t claim ownership of the Content you provide on the Service. You are responsible for your Content.&lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;If the owner of your organizational domain has assumed control of your account, please contact your administrator to understand your rights to your Content.&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;/li&gt;
                    &lt;li&gt;Who can access my Content?
                        &lt;p&gt;If you share Content in public areas of the Service, through features that permit public sharing of Content, or in shared areas available to others you&#39;ve chosen, you agree that anyone you&#39;ve shared Content with may, for free, use, save, reproduce, distribute, display, and transmit that Content in connection with their use of the Service and other Microsoft, or its licensees&#39;, products, and services. If you don&#39;t want others to have that ability, don&#39;t use the Service to share your Content. Additionally, if the owner of your organizational domain has assumed control of your account, your administrator will have access to your Content.&lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;You represent and warrant that for the duration of this Agreement you have (and will have) all the rights necessary for the Content you upload or share on the Service and that the use of the Content, as contemplated in this section 2.2, won&#39;t violate any law.&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;/li&gt;
                    &lt;li&gt;What does Microsoft do with my Content? When you transmit or upload Content to the Service, you&#39;re giving Microsoft the worldwide right, without charge, to use Content as necessary: to provide the Service to you, and to improve Microsoft products and services. Microsoft uses and protects your Content as outlined in the privacy statement referenced in section 4.&lt;/li&gt;
                    &lt;li&gt;What type of Content or actions aren&#39;t permitted? In order to protect our customers and the Service, we have established this Code of Conduct governing the use of the Service. Content or actions that violate this Agreement aren&#39;t permitted.
                        &lt;ol class=&quot;roman_counter&quot;&gt;
                            &lt;li&gt;Don&#39;t use the Service to do anything illegal.&lt;/li&gt;
                            &lt;li&gt;Don&#39;t engage in any activity that exploits, harms, or threatens to harm children.&lt;/li&gt;
                            &lt;li&gt;Don&#39;t send spam or use your account to help others send spam. Spam is unsolicited bulk email, postings or instant messages.&lt;/li&gt;
                            &lt;li&gt;Don&#39;t display inappropriate images (e.g. nudity, bestiality, pornography).&lt;/li&gt;
                            &lt;li&gt;Don&#39;t engage in activity that is false or misleading (e.g. attempts to ask for money under false pretenses, impersonating someone else).&lt;/li&gt;
                            &lt;li&gt;Don&#39;t engage in activity that is harmful to the Service or others (e.g. viruses, stalking, hate speech, advocating violence against others).&lt;/li&gt;
                            &lt;li&gt;Don&#39;t infringe upon the rights of others (e.g. unauthorized sharing of copyrighted music, resale or other distribution of Bing maps, photographs and other Content).&lt;/li&gt;
                            &lt;li&gt;Don&#39;t engage in activity that violates the privacy of others.&lt;/li&gt;
                            &lt;li&gt;Don&#39;t use the Service in any manner that could interfere with, disrupt, negatively affect or inhibit other users from fully enjoying the Service, or that could damage, disable, overburden or impair the functioning of the Service in any manner.&lt;/li&gt;
                            &lt;li&gt;Don&#39;t send any unsolicited or unauthorized advertising, solicitations, promotional materials, spam, junk mail, chain letters or pyramid schemes, or conceal or misrepresent the identity of senders of emails, for the purpose of sending spam or other commercial messages.&lt;/li&gt;
                            &lt;li&gt;Don&#39;t harvest or collect information about other users, including their email addresses, without their consent.&lt;/li&gt;
                            &lt;li&gt;Don&#39;t use any robot, spider, crawler, scraper or other automated means or interface not provided by us to access the Service or to extract data.&lt;/li&gt;
                            &lt;li&gt;Don&#39;t reverse engineer any aspect of the Service or do anything that might discover source code or bypass or circumvent measures employed to prevent or limit access to any area, content or code of the Service (except as otherwise expressly permitted by law).&lt;/li&gt;
                            &lt;li&gt;Don&#39;t use or attempt to use any account you are not authorized to use.&lt;/li&gt;
                            &lt;li&gt;Don&#39;t impersonate or post on behalf of any person or entity or otherwise misrepresent your affiliation with a person or entity.&lt;/li&gt;
                            &lt;li&gt;Don&#39;t attempt to circumvent any content filtering techniques we may employ, or attempt to access any service or area of the Service that you are not authorized to access.&lt;/li&gt;
                        &lt;/ol&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;In many cases Microsoft is alerted to violations of the Code of Conduct through customer complaints, but we may deploy automated technologies to detect child pornography or abusive behavior that might harm the system, our customers, or others. When investigating these matters, Microsoft or its agents will review Content in order to resolve the issue. This is in addition to the uses we describe in this Agreement and the Privacy Statements.&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;/li&gt;
                    &lt;li&gt;Can Microsoft remove my Content from the Service? Yes. Microsoft will remove, limit distribution of, or disable access to your Content if we determine it&#39;s in violation of this Agreement, we receive a complaint from another user, we receive a notice of intellectual property infringement, or other legal instruction for removal. We may also block delivery of a communication (like email or instant message) to or from the Service as part of our effort to protect the Service or our customers, or otherwise enforce the terms of this Agreement.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;/ol&gt;
            &lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;din-regular&quot;&gt;Term and Service cancellation/termination&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;ol&gt;
                    &lt;li&gt;What is the term of this Agreement? This Agreement will remain in effect until September 30th 2015 or the first availability of a commercial release of the Service, whichever is first.&lt;/li&gt;
                    &lt;li&gt;What happens if I don&#39;t abide by this Agreement? If you violate this Agreement, there are a range of actions we may take including removing your Content from the Service, suspending or cancelling your access to the Service, disabling or terminating your organizational account, and/or referring such activity to appropriate authorities. Content that is deleted may be irretrievable.&lt;/li&gt;
                    &lt;li&gt;Are there other ways I could lose access to the Service? Yes. Microsoft may stop providing portions of the Service, in accordance with section 1.3.
                        &lt;p&gt;Additionally, if the owner of your organizational domain has assumed control of your account, your administrator may modify your access to the Service.&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;/li&gt;
                    &lt;li&gt;How can the Service be terminated? You may terminate the Service associated with your organizational account at any time and for any reason, unless the owner of your organizational account has assumed control of your account. In such case, speak with your administrator to terminate your account. For more information on how to close your account, please review this documentation: &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/articles/471189&quot;&gt;http://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/articles/471189&lt;/a&gt;.
                        &lt;p&gt;Microsoft may also suspend or cancel the Service, or terminate this Agreement at any time for any reason by providing 30 days&#39; notice.&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;/li&gt;
                    &lt;li&gt;What happens if my Service is terminated? If your Service is terminated (whether by you or us), or by your administrator, your right to use the Service stops immediately and your license to use the software related to the Service ends. You must then uninstall that software, or, alternatively, we may disable it. If your organizational account is closed (whether by you or us, or your administrator), your right to use your organizational account stops immediately. If the Service is terminated, we will retain your Content in a limited function account for 90 days. After the 90 day retention period ends, Microsoft will disable your account and delete the Content. The Service may not support retention or extraction of software provided by you. Microsoft has no liability for the deletion of your Content as described in this section.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;/ol&gt;
            &lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;din-regular&quot;&gt;Privacy&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Your privacy is important to us. Please note that since this is a preview service, it may be subject to reduced or different security, compliance and privacy commitments. We describe how we use and protect your Content and any information we collect from you in the &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&#39;http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=512132&#39;&gt;Microsoft Online Services Privacy Statement&lt;/a&gt; (the &#39;Privacy Statement&#39;). The Privacy Statement is important so please read it carefully. This Agreement incorporates the Privacy Statement by reference. By using the Service or agreeing to these terms, you consent to Microsoft&#39;s collection, use and disclosure of your Content and information as described in the Privacy Statement. References to Trust Center in the Privacy Statement do not apply. You also consent to Microsoft using the contact information you provided to send you communications relating to your use of Microsoft products and services and to the security of your account. We may also send you promotional emails and contact you via telephone calls about Microsoft products and services.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;For the purposes of the Privacy Statement, until the time that the owner of the internet domain for your organizational account (e.g., &#39;your employer&#39;) assumes control of your account, references to the administrator and customer apply to you.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;din-regular&quot;&gt;Service disruptions and backup&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;We strive to keep the Service up and running; however, all online services suffer occasional disruptions and outages, and Microsoft isn&#39;t liable for any disruption or loss you may suffer as a result. You should regularly backup the Content that you store on the Service. Having a regular backup plan and following it can help you prevent loss of your Content.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;din-regular&quot;&gt;Software&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;ol&gt;
                    &lt;li&gt;What terms govern the software that is part of the Service? Unless accompanied by a separate license agreement, any software provided by us to you as part of the Service is subject to the terms of this Agreement. The software is licensed, not sold, and Microsoft reserves all rights to the software not expressly granted by Microsoft, whether by implication, estoppel, or otherwise. If this Agreement governs the website you&#39;re viewing, any third-party scripts or code, linked to or referenced from this website, are licensed to you by the third parties that own such code, not by Microsoft.&lt;/li&gt;
                    &lt;li&gt;How can I use the software that is provided as part of the Service? We grant you the right to install and use one copy of the software per device on a worldwide basis for use by only one person at a time as part of your use of the Service, but only if you comply with all other terms in this Agreement.&lt;/li&gt;
                    &lt;li&gt;Are there things I can&#39;t do with the software or Service? Yes. In addition to the other restrictions in this Agreement, you may not circumvent or bypass any technological protection measures in or relating to the software or Service or disassemble, decompile, or reverse engineer any software or other aspect of the Service that&#39;s included in or accessible through the Service, except and only to the extent that the applicable copyright law expressly permits doing so; separate components of the software or Service for use on different devices; publish, copy, rent, lease, or lend the software or the Service; or transfer the software, any software licenses, or any rights to access or use the Service. You may not use the Service in any unauthorized way that could interfere with anyone else&#39;s use of them or gain access to any service, data, account, or network. You may not enable access to the Service by unauthorized third-party applications.&lt;/li&gt;
